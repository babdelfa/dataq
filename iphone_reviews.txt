1 My first iPhone in 10 years. Pre-ordered and got on launch day. Mostly satisfied. Battery is superb can use it for 2-3 days before charging as I'm not heavy user. Wish the 120hz is not variable or made better compatible for some apps it even flickers or stutter feel when scrolling. Also miss the back button and Touch ID from my high end Samsung models.
2 I love Apple in general and upgraded from an Xs Max to this phone and it feels great. The refresh rate and the squared edges are good. My screen slightly scratched on the first day though so I am a little disappointed. I didn't even let it touch any hard surfaces it was just there one day after getting my phone. Battery life is insanely good and so it the camera.
3 It took forever for them to hand me my phone. They opened my the box and put their finger prints all over my phone. Supposedly, they had to activate it?? I don't know but I sure didn't appreciate them taking matters into their own hands (literally). Was there for an hour just staring at the girl at the register trying to figure out what they were doing. 
4 Camera is awful. After comparison with iPhone 12, 11 and 8. You better off with android or older iPhones because the camera of this phone sucks. Not bright very dull. Not what you expect from a newer phone model.
5 Preordered this phone on September 20th, phone deliveries launched September 24th and I'm sitting here on September 27th writing a review based on my experience so far rather than on the phone that I still don't have and the company doesn't even provide an estimate of when it'll be available.
6 I upgraded from the Iphone 12 Pro Max in hope of better battery life and snappier processor. However, I cannot really feel much of a difference except for the 120hz screen which accounts for a smoother scrolling experience. Apple says that Battery life is supposed to be better but I think it is pretty similar to the Iphone 12 Pro Max due to the 120hz screen consuming more power.
